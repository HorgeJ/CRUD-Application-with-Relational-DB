## Basics of PHP study notes
This will contain my notes as I freshen up on my PHP skills and serve as a refrence guide as I build my crud application 

### PHP Tag
This triggers PHP commands and the echo 
```PHP
<?php
  echo "Hello World";
?>
```

### The $ Symbol
This symbol must be placed infront of all variables. It makes the PHP parser faster as it will instantly know when it comes across a variable.

```PHP
<?php
  $myCounter = 0;
  $myString = "Hello World"
?>
```
