## PHP Functions
Blocks of code that we are able to reuse by just calling them. Made of up user defined functions and system functions.

### User Defined Functions
A function may be defined using syntax such as the following: 
```PHP
<?php
  function foo($arg_1, $arg_2, /* ..., */ $arg_n)
  {
      echo "Example function.\n";
      return $retval;
}
?>
```
